reacTIVision 1.6
————————————————

* fully implemented /tuio/2Dblb profile
  detect plain blobs, plus optional blobs for fingers and fiducials
* improved precision and robustness of finger tracking
* improved angle and position resolution of fiducial tracking
* enabled alternative amoeba symbol sets (default, small, tiny)

* integrated the TUIO 1.1 library
  allows alternative UDP,TCP, Web and Flash transport

* converted portVideo into an external LGPL library
  - process all available cameras and image formats
  - allow camera selection during runtime (press K)
  - implement V4L2_PIX_FMT_GREY greyscale pixelformat for Linux
  - add PS3Eye driver for MacOS X (thanks to Sebestyén Gábor)

* completely removed SDL dependencies for all non-GUI classes
* removed the classic fiducials and legacy amoeba tree
* removed the alternative MIDI functionality
  (this should be provided by an external TUIOtoMIDI converter)
